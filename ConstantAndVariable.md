#Constant and Variable

##definition
You can define a few constants or variable connected with each other in the same line.

###Let bindings
> Prefer `let`-bindings over `var`-bindings wherever possible

'The Art of Readable Code' chapter 9 explains why you should use constant.

###Type
####When specifying a type, always associate the colon with the identifier
> When specifying the type of an identifier, always put the colon immediately after the identifier, followed by a space and then the type name.  
> Also, when specifying the type of a dictionary, always put the colon immediately after the key type, followed by a space and then the value type.

####specify when constant and variable's type is ambiguous
* Int, UInt
* CGFloat, Float, Double
